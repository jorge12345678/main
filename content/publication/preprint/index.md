abstract: Kitchen support robots are being used more frequently in the gastronomic sector. This type of robots represent a solution in the food industry by allowing processes to be automated, optimizing costs and standardizing the quality of the final product. This work is focused on the development and implementation of a robotic bartender system for automatic preparation of Pisco Sour, a peruvian drink recognized worldwide. In particular, the article presents a comprehensive description of the procedure to prepare Pisco Sour using a robotic arm and some additional subsystems integrated into a single workstation. The same procedure recommended by Pisco Sour professionals is used. Based on tests carried out at a social event, the technical specifications of the system are validated, indicating information such as continuous operating time, preparation time for each portion, frequency of change of input supply, etc. Finally, the operating conclusions are presented and the identified improvement opportunities are mentioned. These insights can be used for the development of new systems for the preparation of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages such as cocktails, coffee and soft drinks.

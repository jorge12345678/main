As part of the development of multiple aquatic robots for monitoring various physicochemical parameters financed by the National Innovation Program in Fisheries and Aquaculture (PNIPA), I was in charge of the electronic system development and validation tests of the UUV. This was carried out on beaches in northern Peru, as shown in Figure 1.

Displacement and high-quality underwater video recording tests were conducted. Additionally, parameters such as depth and temperature were measured. The robot uses rear thrusters for its displacement and tunnel-type thrusters for turns. Figure 2 shows the prototype used in the tests, which did not have a casing due to time constraints.

In the field tests, the prototype's waterproofing, its displacement, and limitations in the face of the marine current were validated. Images of the seabed were captured in shallow water, where a significant amount of underwater vegetation was observed.

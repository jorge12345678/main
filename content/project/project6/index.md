As part of the development of multiple aquatic robots financed by the National Innovation Program in Fisheries and Aquaculture (PNIPA), I was in charge of coordinating and conducting validation tests of the catamaran-type aquatic robot by teleoperating it in a bay. These tests involved teleoperating the robot to assess balance and maneuverability. Figure 1 shows tests of a preliminary version of the robot in a bay frequented by fishermen and mariculturists.

The USV is equipped with a portable weather station, a deployable multiparameter probe for measuring water quality parameters, and an underwater ROV for submarine inspection, as shown in the following video.

The Cordillera Blanca, which is part of the Andes Mountains, has 882 glacial lakes according to the National Water Authority. Due to the global warming there has been a great reduction in its glaciers, which directly affects its lakes and can generate overflows and landslides. Figure 1 shows a partial map of the Cordillera Blanca and the location of the monitored lagoons.

In August 2020, Tumi Robotics with the support of the National Service of Natural Areas Protected by the State (SERNANP) measured the water quality and depth parameters of 3 glacial lakes located in the Andes Mountains. These lakes are located at more than 4400 m.a.s.l as shown in Figure 2, so extreme conditions needed to be considered. My role was as a Field Engineer and my duties included the deployment of the USV and teleoperation for data capture.

This project represented a significant breakthrough in Peruvian robotics, being the first time an aquatic robot inspected the lakes of the Cordillera Blanca. The following video showcases the fieldwork conducted, along with the beautiful nature of the Peruvian highlands.

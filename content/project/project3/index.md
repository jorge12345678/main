title: Using a Marine Surface Vehicle (USV) and a Drone for water body characterization in the Amazon.

summary: This project, developed by the Peruvian company Tumi Robotics, seeks to combat pollution in the Amazon caused by illegal mining activities using a robotic solution composed of a surface aquatic robot and a drone. Using specialized sensors, it is sought to diagnose contaminated water bodies so that local institutions can propose solution alternatives.

In December 2020, the company Tumi Robotics together with the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) and the Amazon Scientific Innovation Center (CINCIA) began the development of the project titled: "Development and Implementation of an Integrated Vehicle System. Marine Surface (USV) and Aerial Drone for characterization of lagoons in Madre de Dios". Financed by the National Innovation Program in Fisheries and Aquaculture (PNIPA). My role was Principal Investigator and my functions included the technical management of the project as well as the development and field validation of the USV.

The Pampa area is one of the areas with the highest rate of Amazon destruction due to illegal mining, as shown in Figure 1. It is estimated that more than 5 000 hectares of forests were converted into highly contaminated lagoons. To evaluate the evolution of nature and biodiversity, it is necessary to characterize these bodies of water, which is why the need for a robotic system that is easy to transport and that avoids putting people's health at risk when measuring contaminated lagoons was evident.

The USV was light and compact in size, which allowed it to be easily transported to the various measurement points as seen in Figure 2. The function of this robot was to perform bathymetry in addition to measuring physical and chemical parameters of water quality in real time. In this way it was possible to approximate a 3D model of the geography of the bottom of the bodies of water and the variation of their water quality parameters. The drone used was a commercial one and had RTK positioning technology and a 3D laser scanner allowing reconstruction the area around the lagoon quite accurately.

Characterization of natural pools was also carried out as shown in Figure 3, where challenging working conditions such as abundant vegetation and the presence of sporadic rains were presented.

The following video summarizes the work developed throughout the project as well as the results obtained. The necessary field logistics and the support of collaborators from the different Peruvian institutions mentioned are evident.
